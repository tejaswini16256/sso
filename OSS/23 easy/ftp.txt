Steps to Set Up FTP and Allow a New User to Access the FTP Server:
1. Install FTP Server

For FTP, we'll use vsftpd (Very Secure FTP Daemon), which is one of the most commonly used FTP servers.

Run the following commands to install it:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install vsftpd

This will install the FTP server.
2. Create a New User for FTP Access

You can create a new user that will be able to access the FTP server.

    Create the user:

sudo adduser newuser

Replace newuser with the desired username.

Set the password for the new user:

    sudo passwd newuser

    Enter the password for newuser when prompted.

3. Configure vsftpd for FTP Access

Now, you need to configure vsftpd to allow FTP access.

    Open the vsftpd configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf

Modify the configuration to allow the user to connect:

    Make sure the following lines are present and set as shown:

        listen=YES
        listen_ipv6=NO
        anonymous_enable=NO
        local_enable=YES
        write_enable=YES
        chroot_local_user=YES
        allow_writeable_chroot=YES

        Explanation of settings:
            listen=YES: Allows vsftpd to listen on IPv4.
            listen_ipv6=NO: Disable IPv6 listening.
            anonymous_enable=NO: Disables anonymous FTP login (ensure only registered users can log in).
            local_enable=YES: Allows local users to log in.
            write_enable=YES: Allows write access (uploading files).
            chroot_local_user=YES: Chroots (locks) users to their home directory for security.
            allow_writeable_chroot=YES: Allows writing in the chrooted environment.

    Save the file and exit:
        Press CTRL + X, then Y to save, and Enter to confirm.

4. Restart vsftpd Service

Once the configuration is updated, restart the vsftpd service to apply the changes:

sudo systemctl restart vsftpd

5. Allow FTP Through the Firewall (if applicable)

If you're using a firewall like UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall), you will need to allow FTP traffic (ports 20 and 21) through.

sudo ufw allow 20/tcp
sudo ufw allow 21/tcp
sudo ufw reload

6. Verify FTP Service is Running

To check if vsftpd is running, use the following command:

sudo systemctl status vsftpd

You should see something like:

‚óè vsftpd.service - VSFTPD FTP server
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/vsftpd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since ...

7. Log in Using FTP

Once the FTP server is running, you can test logging in with your new user.

    Connect using FTP:

ftp localhost

Enter the username: Enter the new username you created (newuser).

    Name (localhost:your-username): newuser

    Enter the password: Type the password for newuser.

8. Upload/Download Files

Once logged in, you can use FTP commands to upload or download files:

    To list files in the current directory:

ls

To upload a file:

put filename

To download a file:

get filename

To change directories:

cd directory_name

To exit the FTP session:

    bye

9. Secure FTP (Optional)

By default, FTP is insecure as it sends data (including passwords) in plaintext. If security is a concern, you should consider setting up FTPS (FTP Secure) or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol), which encrypts the communication.

To set up FTPS or SFTP, you would need additional configuration (e.g., SSL certificates for FTPS or enabling SSH for SFTP).

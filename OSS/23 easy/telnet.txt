1. Create a New User

You first need to create a new user on the system if you haven't already. You can use the following commands:

    Add a new user:

sudo adduser newuser

Replace newuser with the username you want to create.

Set a password for the new user:

    sudo passwd newuser

    Enter the password when prompted.

2. Check or Modify the Telnet Configuration

Ensure that the Telnet service is configured to allow logins for the new user. This is typically managed via xinetd or telnetd.

    Locate the Telnet configuration file:

    The configuration file for Telnet service is usually located in the /etc/xinetd.d/ directory. You need to make sure that Telnet is enabled and configured correctly to accept user logins.

    Open the configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/xinetd.d/telnet

Configure the Telnet service to allow the user:

Ensure that the file has the following basic settings:

service telnet
{
    disable = no
    socket_type = stream
    wait = no
    user = root
    server = /usr/sbin/in.telnetd
    log_on_failure += USERID
}

In the user = root line, you can change it to the user that you want Telnet to run as (though running Telnet as root is not recommended for security reasons).

Ensure Telnet is allowed to run:

The disable = no line is crucial, as it enables the Telnet service. If it's set to yes, Telnet will be disabled.

Restart xinetd:

After making changes, restart xinetd to apply the new settings:

    sudo systemctl restart xinetd

3. Allow User Through Firewall

If you're using a firewall like ufw, you might need to allow the Telnet port (port 23) through the firewall:

sudo ufw allow 23/tcp
sudo ufw reload

4. Check User Permissions

If the Telnet service is configured to allow logins and youâ€™ve created the new user, ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to log in. For this, check /etc/passwd and /etc/group files to ensure the user isn't restricted from logging in.

    Check the /etc/passwd file:

    cat /etc/passwd | grep newuser

    This should show an entry for newuser.

5. Log in Using Telnet

Once you've created the user and configured Telnet, you should be able to log in using Telnet with the new user credentials:

telnet localhost

    Enter the username: newuser
    Enter the password: [password you set for newuser]
